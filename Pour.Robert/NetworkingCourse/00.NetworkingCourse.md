# Course: Networking Fundamentals, Protocols, and Cisco Ecosystem

This document covers the theoretical foundations of the OSI model, standard industry protocols (TCP/IP, SIP), and proprietary protocols specific to Cisco equipment.

## Part 1: Foundations and the OSI Model 🏗️

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a theoretical standard that normalizes communication between computer systems by dividing it into 7 abstraction layers.

### 1.1 The 7 Layers of the OSI Model

Data flows down from layer 7 to 1 during transmission (encapsulation) and up from 1 to 7 during reception (decapsulation).

| Layer | Name | Main Role | Data Unit (PDU) | Examples / Hardware |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **7** | **Application** | Direct interface with the user and software. | Data | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, SSH |
| **6** | **Presentation** | Translation, encryption, and compression (formatting). | Data | ASCII, JPEG, SSL/TLS |
| **5** | **Session** | Management of communication sessions (open, close). | Data | NetBIOS, RPC |
| **4** | **Transport** | Reliable or unreliable transfer, segmentation, and reassembly. | Segment (TCP) / Datagram (UDP) | TCP, UDP |
| **3** | **Network** | Logical addressing and routing (finding the path). | Packet | IP (IPv4, IPv6), Routers |
| **2** | **Data Link** | Physical addressing (MAC), error detection on the link. | Frame | Ethernet, Switches, VLANs |
| **1** | **Physical** | Binary transmission over the medium (cable, waves). | Bit | Cables (RJ45, Fiber), Hubs |

### [➡️ Next Section: 1.2 The Mechanics of the Model (Encapsulation)](./1.2.Mechanics.md)

Discover how data travels through the layers (Encapsulation/Decapsulation) with concrete examples like Email and VoIP.

## [➡️ Go to Part 2: Standard "Lingua Franca" Protocols](./Part.2.Standard.Protocols.md) 🗣️

Deep dive into the protocols that power the Internet:
* **Layer 4:** TCP vs UDP (Reliability vs Speed).
* **Infrastructure:** DHCP (Addressing) and DNS (Naming).

---

## [➡️ Go to Part 3: The Cisco Ecosystem](./Part.3.Cisco.Ecosystem.md) 🏢

Explore the proprietary protocols used on Cisco equipment:
* **Discovery:** CDP.
* **Switching:** VTP, DTP, PAgP, PVST+.
* **Routing & Redundancy:** EIGRP, HSRP.

### Summary for Exam or Practice

1.  **OSI:** The theoretical roadmap essential for troubleshooting.
2.  **TCP/IP:** Universal standards (TCP for reliability, UDP for real-time).
3.  **Cisco:** An ecosystem aimed at automating management (VTP, DTP) and maximizing availability (EIGRP, HSRP, PVST+).
